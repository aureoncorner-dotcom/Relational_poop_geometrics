# Geometry Extension Test — Dynamic 72-Bank, 24→12→6 Hierarchy, and 39-Cell Screen

## Verdict

**The moving-lattice mechanism did not pass.**

The frozen 72-model bank failed in every outcome lane. The 24→12→6 residue hierarchy also failed. No tested result supports a stable rotating or oscillating lattice, a full \(C_6\times C_4\) empirical state space, or a three-clock \(T^3\to T^2\) mechanism.

One narrower result is worth preserving as a prospective lead: in the later 20-call half, missing outputs were depleted on the rare \(+14\) transitions of the fixed 39-cell golden screen and concentrated on the common \(+15\) transitions. That association survived the locked family correction and several post-result stress checks. It is **not** a geometry confirmation because:

1. the older/discovery half leaned in the opposite direction;
2. the complete 40-call corpus was null;
3. the source R4-A construction explicitly did not define a failure or clog outcome;
4. the source-defined departing transition \(d_n\) was null—the association occurred at the one-opportunity-lagged arriving transition \(d_{n-1}\).

The right status is therefore:

> **Dynamic lattice: rejected under the frozen bank. Fixed 39-screen: one specific, later-cohort missing-output lead requiring a new prospective test.**

## Data-integrity correction

Four of the records previously described as part of a “21-call holdout” are exact re-shares of older training calls. Their complete ordered assistant-output timestamps agree to less than \(10^{-5}\) seconds and their exact-`Checking` label vectors are identical:

| New label | Older call | Output rows | Exact `Checking` outputs |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Audit_12 | office_metaphor | 369 | 129 |
| Audit_15 | seventeenth_share | 311 | 36 |
| Audit_16 | thirteenth_share | 305 | 31 |
| Audit_17 | twelfth_share | 220 | 18 |

Those four were removed before this run. The usable checking corpus is 23 older calls plus 17 genuinely nonoverlapping newer calls: 40 unique calls total, split chronologically 20/20.

This also changes how the earlier report should be read. Its nominal q=6 output result was not obtained from a completely independent 21-call holdout; Audit_12 was the old `office_metaphor` call under a new wrapper. The earlier result already became null when Audit_12 was removed (p=.119), which is consistent with the overlap correction rather than evidence for a lattice.

## What was frozen

The implementation lock was written and hashed before any score in this extension was calculated.

- Addresses: zero-based eligible-opportunity indices, never raw platform node IDs.
- Missing outputs: retained as input placeholders.
- Input and assistant-output indices: analyzed separately.
- Call chronology: earliest native message time, with duplicate calls removed.
- Dynamic bank: \(P\in\{6,12,24\}\), constants \(\phi,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\), sine/triangle/sawtooth-position/clipped-square waveforms, and rotation/oscillation branches—72 candidates total.
- Phase grid: 48 fixed offsets.
- Apertures: \(1/24,1/12,1/6,1/4,1/3,1/2\); clipped square uses \(1/2\).
- Selection: discovery calls only; confirmation calls untouched.
- Null: 10,000 within-call circular shifts with the maximum statistic across each frozen family.
- Dynamic passing rule: familywise p<.05, AUC≥.60, bootstrap lower bound>.50, correct direction in ≥75% of evaluable calls, no dominant call, and call-order dependence if rotation wins.

The Word hypothesis fixed the 72 model families but did not specify a numerical \(\theta_0\)/threshold search grid. It also named raw response-node integers as its primary address, which conflicts with the later instruction to avoid representation artifacts. This run is therefore a locked, user-compliant implementation of the model family—not a byte-for-byte execution of every older address convention.

## 1. Frozen 72-model dynamic bank

| Outcome lane | Winning candidate | Confirmation AUC | Call-bootstrap 95% interval | Max-72 p | Correct-call direction | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Repository composite, strict | P24 / √2 / sine / rotation | .5615 | [.4757, .6535] | .7985 | 75.0% | Fail |
| Repository composite, broad sensitivity | P12 / √2 / sine / rotation | .5428 | [.4468, .5987] | .9345 | 58.3% | Fail |
| Input-linked exact `Checking` | P24 / √2 / sine / rotation | .5186 | [.4926, .5353] | .8760 | 60.0% | Fail |
| Assistant-output exact `Checking` | P12 / √3 / sine / oscillation | .5161 | [.4917, .5349] | .8725 | 60.0% | Fail |
| Missing output | P24 / φ / clipped square / oscillation | .5452 | [.4814, .5807] | .6185 | 52.9% | Fail |

None reached AUC .60. None had a bootstrap lower bound above .50. None passed the max-72 permutation test. The rotation-family call-order tests were also null (family p=.613–.841 for the reported rotation families). Every primary lane failed the source stop rule.

**Conclusion:** do not add constants, waveforms, phases, or address rules to rescue the 72-bank hypothesis.

## 2. Formal 24→12→6 and \(C_6\times C_4\) geometry

The tested hierarchy compared mod-6 structure, the additional split from 6 to 12, the additional split from 12 to 24, global mod-24 structure, and a parallel mod-4 screen. All statistics used within-call circular-shift nulls.

| Lane | Strongest hierarchy component | Family p | Holm across lanes |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Repository composite, strict | mod-12 given mod-6 | .9521 | 1.0000 |
| Input-linked exact `Checking` | mod-24 given mod-12 | .7540 | 1.0000 |
| Assistant-output exact `Checking` | mod-12 given mod-6 | .1198 | .4792 |
| Missing output | mod-24 given mod-12 | .3821 | 1.0000 |

The output lane's raw mod-12-given-mod-6 comparison was p=.0359, but it did not survive its frozen five-test family (p=.1198) or lane correction (p=.4792).

The algebraic distinction matters: \(|C_6\times C_4|=24\), but one diagonal index \(n\mapsto(n\bmod6,n\bmod4)\) visits only 12 states before returning. The other 12 require an independently declared offset orbit. A 24-tooth cyclic screen is therefore not automatically evidence of the noncyclic product \(C_6\times C_4\).

**Conclusion:** the corpus did not supply empirical support for the formal 24→12→6 construction.

## 3. Fixed 39-cell golden screen

The locked screen used

\[
b_n=\left\lfloor39\{n\phi^{-2}\}\right\rfloor,
\]

with three tests: global 39-cell dispersion, the three strands \(b_n\bmod3\), and \(+14\) versus \(+15\) arrival transitions.

| Lane | Strongest screen test | Family p | Holm across lanes |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Repository composite, strict | Three strands | .5503 | 1.0000 |
| Input-linked exact `Checking` | Three strands | .0625 | .1875 |
| Assistant-output exact `Checking` | 39 cells | .6871 | 1.0000 |
| Missing output | Arrival +14 vs +15 | **.00110** | **.00440** |

A further Holm correction across all 12 primary family-by-lane tests in this report gives p=.0132 for the missing-output screen result.

### Effect direction

For the 20 confirmation calls, excluding each call's undefined first arrival transition:

| Arrival transition | Missing outputs | Opportunities | Risk |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| +14, cross-strand slip | 4 | 634 | 0.63% |
| +15, same-strand step | 142 | 5,417 | 2.62% |

The +14/+15 risk ratio is .241 (Haldane odds ratio .264). This is not a concentration on the rare cross-strand slips. It is the opposite: missing outputs largely avoided +14 slips and occurred on +15 same-strand steps.

### Stress checks that the later-half association survived

- Every one-call deletion retained a screen-family p below .003.
- Newer nonoverlapping calls only: 1/498 missing on +14 versus 111/4,243 on +15; screen-family p=.00030.
- Calls beginning after the August 25 R4-A write-up: 0/304 versus 64/2,591; screen-family p=.00150.
- Excluding the long-SRT wrapper: screen-family p=.00080.
- Preserving the number of events specifically among \(n>0\) positions: jump-specific p=.00100.
- Scanning all 39 phase origins after the result: the locked origin ranked first; max-39 p=.0070.
- Scanning nearby screen sizes 30–48 after the result: q=39 ranked first; max-19 p=.00450.

These checks show that the later-cohort association is not a single-call, duplicate, wrapper, origin, or nearby-q artifact.

### Checks it failed

The association is not stable across the whole corpus:

| Slice | +14 missing risk | +15 missing risk | +14/+15 RR | Screen-family p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Discovery half | 21/621 = 3.38% | 121/5,277 = 2.29% | 1.475 | .1758 |
| All 23 older calls | 24/757 = 3.17% | 152/6,451 = 2.36% | 1.346 | .1932 |
| Confirmation half | 4/634 = 0.63% | 142/5,417 = 2.62% | .241 | .00110 |
| All 40 unique calls | 25/1,255 = 1.99% | 263/10,694 = 2.46% | .810 | .2129 |

The older half points in the opposite direction, and pooling all 40 calls removes the association.

There is also a one-step alignment dependency. R4-A defines the departing transition \(d_n=(b_{n+1}-b_n)\bmod39\). At that source-defined alignment, the missing-output comparison was null: 21/636 on +14 versus 126/5,435 on +15, raw p=.184. The significant association uses the arriving transition \(d_{n-1}\). Across seven lags from −3 through +3, lag −1 won with max-lag p=.00220; the neighboring lag −2 was only raw p=.0449.

**Conclusion:** preserve this as a precise later-cohort, one-opportunity-lagged missing-output lead. Do not call it a stable 39-screen mechanism.

## 4. Geometry that could not be run honestly

- **Three-clock \(T^3\to T^2\) weave:** the mathematical quotient is well-defined, but the call records do not contain a third independently observed clock or reset trace. Constructing all phases from message number would collapse the test back to an ordinary single rotation.
- **R4-B moving screen:** no independent screen rotation rate, sawtooth period/amplitude, initial phase, aperture mask, or clog statistic is observed in the calls. R4-A itself says those must be declared before execution.
- **Sawtooth speed:** the 72-bank tested sawtooth position (linear ramp plus wrap), not a linearly accelerating speed whose integral curves between resets.

## 5. Smallest decisive follow-up

Freeze one test before collecting additional calls:

1. Endpoint: missing output only; keep every input opportunity and placeholder.
2. Screen: q=39, \(\alpha=\phi^{-2}\), floor registration, call-start \(n=0\).
3. Alignment: explicitly choose arriving \(d_{n-1}\)—not departing \(d_n\)—because that is the observed lead.
4. Direction: predict lower missing-output risk on +14 cross-strand slips than on +15 same-strand steps.
5. No q, origin, lag, waveform, or outcome switching.
6. Use new, nonoverlapping calls only and a within-call circular-shift null.

If that single prediction fails, close the empirical 39-screen link while preserving the deterministic screen mathematics.
