Paragraph anchors below refer to the recovered 622-paragraph export. Citation tokens in the raw export have no recoverable link metadata and therefore carry zero substantive evidentiary weight. | Local recovery SHA-256 `acd4bce988fde5525822ccba6c1c51295d4f08bd9850b05c91f07afdf9f741d9`. |

The governing external-evidence hierarchy is:

1. Primary instrument or official record.
2. Independently verified secondary reporting.
3. Source-bearing reconciliation.
4. Document-to-document structural inference.
5. Auditor/model assertion without a recoverable source.
6. Model consensus: **zero evidentiary upgrade**.

Primary instruments do not inherit the claims made about them by a synthesis. Multiple reports derived from the same filing, declaration, leak, press release, or earlier story count as one source family unless they independently verify different evidence.

## 2. Controlled vocabulary and row controls

- **Finding type:** `FACT`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `LEGAL ELEMENT`, `CAUSAL JOIN`, `INTENT / CONSIDERATION`.
- **Evidence state:** `ESTABLISHED`, `PROVISIONALLY ESTABLISHED`, `CONTESTED`, `OPEN`, `NOT ESTABLISHED`, `INDETERMINATE`, `RETIRED / CORRECTED`.
- **Action:** `ADVANCE`, `HOLD`, `CLOSE ON CURRENT RECORD`, `WRONG INSTRUMENT`.
- **Instrument axis:** `P1` primary instrument; `P2` government record; `P3` named-source journalism; `P4` authenticated leak-derived record; `P5` interested-party analysis/filing; `P6` competent evidence conflicts; `X` proposition exceeds the record.
- **Provenance axis:** `SRC-P` primary; `SRC-V` verified secondary; `SRC-L` authenticated leak-derived; `SRC-A` allegation/party assertion.
- `TRUE BILL` and `NO BILL` are retired as controlled states. A closed or not-established row is not exoneration.

Time fields are explicit. Unless a row says otherwise, `as_of=2026-08-17`, `last_verified=2026-08-18`, and `future_event=none`. Static historical records use `recheck=none`; open claims use the event or instrument trigger shown.

Source-concentration codes used on every claim row:

| Code | independent_source_count | sole_source_dependency | source_family_overlap | corroboration_type |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| SC0 | 0 for the proposition | yes; hypothesis/absence only | n/a | none; listed sources are context, counterevidence, or search bounds only |
| SC1-D | 1 | yes | none | one direct/official record family |
| SC1-V | 1 | yes | none | one verified-reporting family |
| SC1-O | 1 effective | yes | yes | repeated/derived sources discounted to one family |
| SC2-D | 2 | no | none | two independent direct/official record families |
| SC2-M | 2 | no | none | mixed direct and independently verified sources |
| SC3-M | 3 or more | no | stated where material | mixed independent record families |

Comparison codes used on every claim row:

| Code | comparison_class | denominator_status | exceptionality_claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMP0 | none required to establish the discrete event/route | not required for existence | none; “unusual,” “exceptional,” and “outlier” remain prohibited |
| CMP1 | comparable offices, officials, contracts, movements, or access networks | missing/not constructed | prohibited until a separately selected denominator exists |
| CMP2 | causal or intent join | comparison cannot supply the missing instrument | prohibited; require actor/action/consideration evidence |

The sample is non-random. Symbolic material influenced initial actor selection but supplies **zero** evidentiary weight. Treatment-group failures are `NULL RESULTS`, not controls.

## 3. Recoverable source catalog

External locators below were checked on 18 August 2026. Unless a row gives a local hash, `archive_path_or_hash=none; live recoverable locator only`. A locator mirror or downstream index is not counted as corroboration of the underlying instrument.

## 6. Known-live, not-yet-adjudicated register

Each row is preserved to prevent silent deletion. Every proposition is `X / SRC-A`, `SC0`, and `HOLD FOR PROVENANCE RECONSTRUCTION`; PROV-001 is a lead only, not evidence. `as_of=2026-08-17`, `last_verified=2026-08-18`.

## 7. Missing-instrument register

An empty search is not automatically evidence of nonexistence. For each item, record whether the instrument should exist under the asserted legal/administrative theory, is agency-held, is exempt/nonpublic, was searched but not found, or is not expected.

Precision queue before any publication: verbatim OGE asset brackets; official roll-call/assumption dates; executive-order rather than “statutory” task-force language; ICE numbers against procurement instruments; Maven order/modification reconciliation; any late-fee amount and its limited meaning.

| RT-08 | Trump crypto = $57M, $580M, $1.2B, $1.4B+, or clean range | **RETIRED / CORRECTED.** Components exist; aggregate **INDETERMINATE** until MISS-TC-01 is completed. |
| RT-09 | DOJ/Senate silence or empty waiver search → no Blanche clearance | **PROHIBITED.** C-05 carries DOJ assertion; C-08/C-09 allow multiple legal paths, sometimes without individualized waiver. |
| RT-10 | OGE/PTR certification → April 7 participation legally cleared | **PROHIBITED overread.** Certification concerns the form; CR-08 remains HOLD. |
| RT-11 | CMS/HHS→ICE→Palantir custody → ELITE ingestion or enforcement harm | **PROHIBITED upgrade.** PL-07 remains NOT ESTABLISHED/HOLD. |
| RT-12 | GSA May 7 page date → Barbaccia appointment | **CORRECTED.** P-08 controls: 2026-02-19; May 7 was an update. |
| RT-13 | Barbaccia reported return → completed return at cutoff | **CORRECTED.** V-04 is a future plan; recheck after 2026-08-31. |
| RT-14 | WIRED’s Jeff Epstein identity correction → full Dialog investigation retraction | **PROHIBITED.** PA-L01 contains a narrow identity correction. No Guardian retraction is encoded without a specific notice. |
| RT-15 | Peter Thiel co-founder overlap → Dialog procurement influence/common command | **PROHIBITED.** PA-P01/PA-V06 establish only the narrow structural fact. |
| RT-16 | Bondi same-date symmetry → human-side evidence | **CUT.** It has zero non-symbolic evidentiary value and remains outside the human spine. |
| RT-17 | “No indication of illegality” → “the WorldClaw arrangement is legal” | **PROHIBITED semantic upgrade.** KL-01 stays HOLD. |
| RT-18 | Model agreement or repeated downstream reporting → corroboration | **ZERO evidentiary upgrade.** Only independently recovered evidence can change a row. |

## 9. Null results and counterevidence ledger

These are treatment-group failures or innocent explanations, not independently selected controls.

| Null ID | Applies to | Preserved null / counterevidence | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| NULL-01 | RP-01–RP-06 | Faith-policy coordination, religious-liberty enforcement, interagency task forces, and equal grant access can be lawful executive functions. | Establishing route does not establish capture; require named beneficiary/exclusion/action join. |
| NULL-02 | CR-03–CR-04 | April 7 memo retained enforcement priorities for fraud, theft/hacking, terrorism, narcotics, trafficking, and related crimes. | Do not describe the memo as ending all crypto enforcement. |
| NULL-03 | CR-05–CR-08 | Transaction report includes dispositions/gifts; DOJ asserts prior clearance; §208 analysis has waiver, regulatory-exemption, no-covered-matter/effect, and screening routes. | Ongoing-interest and noncompliance theories remain unresolved rather than presumed. |
| NULL-04 | CR-09 | No payment, trade, consideration, or intent instrument. | Bribery/self-enrichment closed on current record. |
| NULL-05 | TC-01 | AP and Reuters analyze the same filing under different taxonomies. | Disagreement reveals denominator instability; neither model/outlet vote creates a project aggregate. |
| NULL-06 | TC-02 | 18 U.S.C. §202(c) excludes the President from ordinary employee §208 coverage. | Structural ethics junction remains; ordinary employee criminal-conflict formulation is wrong. |
| NULL-07 | TC-03–TC-04 | Criminal resolution, announced transaction, and pardon chronology do not supply consideration. | Quid pro quo remains NOT ESTABLISHED. |
| NULL-08 | PL-02–PL-04 | $10B is a ceiling, not committed spend; sole-source continuation has asserted IP/FedRAMP/migration/mission rationales; prior order was competed. | Procurement architecture may be real without corrupt steering. |
| NULL-09 | PL-06–PL-08 | Teams transfer is not ingestion; government reports no law-enforcement use for the later file; Palantir reports purge; deletion efforts occurred. | Custody/control concern survives; downstream use/harm does not. |
| NULL-10 | PL-09–PL-13 | Revolving doors and authority can be lawful; Barbaccia participation records absent; Patel system predated him and sale was required. | Person-level steering/participation stays HOLD. |
| NULL-11 | PA-01–PA-05 | AI-moratorium fight involved a broad coalition; public advocacy is ordinary politics; Johnson spokesperson denied policy discussion and said fair-market rent; move-out bounded access. | No Bannon command or Berger consequence. |
| NULL-12 | PA-06–PA-08 | Registration is not attendance; venue cancelled; off-record norms and overlap are not common instruction. | Network established, decision/command absent. |
| NULL-13 | JU-01–JU-05, JU-11 | Selection/advocacy machinery and Senate gatekeeping can be lawful politics; chronology defeats Seid financing arrow; selection does not equal later control. | Pipeline architecture survives without commanded-justice claim. |
| NULL-14 | JU-06 | Friendship/personal-hospitality explanation and Judicial Conference no-referral decision. | Does not erase benefits/amendment; does block automatic influence/violation inference. |
| NULL-15 | JU-07 | *NML Capital* result was 7–1. | Strong counterweight to a bespoke purchased-vote inference; recusal remains case-specific. |
| NULL-16 | JU-08 | Duffy said he had no prior knowledge/contact; aggregate 8–4 firm-outcome count is non-causal. | Transaction fact remains; favorable-treatment claim absent. |
| NULL-17 | JU-09 | Advisory Opinion 107 is fact-specific; complainant history and another colleague’s account complicate the allegation. | Require full firm/case/participation join. |
| NULL-18 | JU-10 | Current disclosures show ordinary reportable items and no identified capture join. | Current-record negative result only, not permanent exoneration. |

## 10. Do-not-state boundaries

Do **not** state as findings on this record:

- a unified cabal, hidden continuous priesthood, occult or supernatural coordination, bloodline, or one command authority controlling all packets;
- secret Palantir command of government, universal data pooling, or common operational control;
- Trump/World Liberty purchased Zhao’s pardon, or the announced MGX/Binance deal was independently verified as completed;
- any canonical Trump crypto-income total of $580M, $1.2B, $1.4B+, or a clean $1.2B–$1.4B range;
- Blanche violated §208 as an adjudicated fact, lacked clearance because no public waiver was found, or acted to enrich himself;
- Blanche’s adult-child gifts were suspicious, exculpatory, or agreement-compliant without the instruments;
- Barbaccia retained stock, steered Palantir work, was appointed in May 2026, or had completed a return to Palantir by the evidence cutoff;
- Patel improperly influenced Palantir procurement, or his required sale independently proves guilt or innocence;
- $795M or $10B was spent/obligated merely because an award ceiling/modification was announced;
- the Medicaid file was ingested into ELITE or generated targets, leads, arrests, detention, or removals;
- Dialog’s planned 2026 Powerscourt event occurred, named registrants co-attended elsewhere, or Dialog coordinated a decision;
- WIRED retracted the Dialog investigation, or the Guardian issued a retraction absent a specific notice;
- Peter Thiel’s co-founder overlap proves Dialog influenced a Palantir contract or that either network shares command;
- Bannon commands administration policy or single-handedly caused the AI-moratorium result;
- Johnson acted on Berger’s direction or maintained indefinite co-residence;
- Seid’s $1.6B funded the Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, or Barrett confirmation campaigns;
- Crow, Singer, or Duffy purchased Supreme Court outcomes; that a recusal violation is adjudicated without a case-specific join; or that a 7–1/aggregate outcome pattern proves consideration;
- Jane Roberts’s reported commissions came from firms in cases Chief Justice Roberts decided without the complete firm→case→participation join;
- Kavanaugh or Barrett is financially captured, or the current negative result permanently exonerates either;
- “the media” as a generalized actor; any media claim must identify an actor, frame, repetition path, access, action, and financial interest where relevant;
- symbolic/mythic observations, including the Bondi date symmetry, as human-side evidence;
- WorldClaw legality or illegality on the unsourced current record;
- source repetition, proximity, chronology, founder overlap, or model agreement as a substitute for a causal or intent instrument.

## 11. Source-recovery changes from the prior handoff

| Change | Register effect |
|---|---|
| Recovered Blanche PTR C-04 | CR-05 dates are source-bearing; adult-child gift mechanics and any Certificate remain HOLD. |
| Applied C-08/C-09 framework | CR-08 now separates four clearance/participation pathways and preserves the no-individualized-instrument state. |
| Recovered T-01 and compared T-02/T-03 taxonomies | TC-01 changed from canonical range to INDETERMINATE aggregate. |
| Recovered ICE redacted J&A P-03 | PL-04’s former “full J&A missing” statement is narrowed: redacted J&A exists; underlying pricing, market research, and alternatives evidence remain missing. |
| Recovered court order/exhibit and source-bearing reporting | PL-06 narrow custody route advances; PL-07 remains NOT ESTABLISHED; PL-08 remains provisional. |
| Recovered GSA P-08 and return reporting V-04 | Feb. 19 appointment controls; return remains a future plan at cutoff. |
| Recovered PA-P01/PA-V06 and PA-L01 update | Thiel common-founder fact advances narrowly; WIRED correction is not a retraction. |
| Recovered PA-V07 | Powerscourt co-attendance remains retired. |
| Recovered JU-P02 and official nomination chronology | $1.6B vehicle advances; Seid→three confirmations remains retired. |
| Recovered justice filings/opinion/guidance | Access/transaction facts advance only to case-specific recusal tests; purchased outcomes remain closed. |

## 12. Review gate

Before this register can become a source-bearing canonical handoff:

1. Confirm or correct the source classifications and source-family counts.
2. Resolve every `HOLD` only by attaching a recoverable instrument or independently verified source; do not promote by prose consensus.
3. Complete MISS-TC-01 before using any Trump crypto aggregate.
4. Attach the operative HHS/CMS–ICE agreement and logs before changing PL-05–PL-08.
5. Recheck Barbaccia after 31 August 2026 and preserve the event as future until completed-employment evidence exists.
6. Keep the known-live rows visible until individually adjudicated or explicitly retired.
7. Preserve the retired-arrow, null-result, counterevidence, and do-not-state ledgers in every later version.
8. Version every state transition with old state, new state, source ID, reviewer, and date.

**Current authorization:** suitable for review and source recovery; not suitable for an unrestricted final synthesis.

## 13. Closing control statement

This register is a map of what the record can presently bear, not an invitation to make inference carry missing weight. Supported facts may advance only within their stated limits; open joins remain `HOLD`; retired arrows stay visible; and null results and counterevidence travel with the claims they constrain. A later version should become narrower or stronger when new instruments arrive—never merely more confident. If a synthesis cannot show the source ID and versioned state transition behind a load-bearing sentence, that sentence does not belong in the evidentiary spine.
