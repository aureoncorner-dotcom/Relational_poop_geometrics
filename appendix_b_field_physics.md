Appendix B

Pre-Run Parameter, Statistical, Fit, Resource, and Immutable-Output Freeze Card

Protocol: Simulation Protocol v0.3-RC1
Companion: Appendix A — Exact Q2 Sector Construction, Axial-Seam Completion, and Algorithm Validation
Appendix status: Structural freeze candidate
Execution status: Not frozen until the generated point tables, production-length table, software fingerprint, and manifest root are completed and hashed
Purpose: Freeze every parameter set, lattice ladder, chain rule, random-number rule, thermalization criterion, stopping rule, fit family, calibration tolerance, verdict condition, resource ceiling, and raw-output convention before target production observables are opened.

All literature benchmark numbers in this appendix are inherited from the main protocol. They are calibration targets, not re-derived claims.

---

B.0. Freeze Boundary

Appendix B separates three classes of information.

B.0.1 Frozen scientific choices

The following are fixed by this appendix:

- microscopic model branches;
- boundary and holonomy conventions;
- gauge couplings;
- anisotropy couplings;
- lattice-size ladders;
- initial coupling brackets;
- deterministic refinement algorithms;
- chain counts;
- RNG algorithm;
- seed derivation;
- thermalization tests;
- autocorrelation estimator;
- blocking and resampling rules;
- reweighting admissibility;
- fit families;
- L_{\min} ladders;
- calibration tolerances;
- first-order diagnostics;
- Q1, Q2, and Q3 verdict rules;
- resource ceilings;
- raw-data schema;
- immutable-output procedure.

None of these may be altered after the execution root is created.

B.0.2 Pilot-filled machine quantities

The following may be measured during calibration-only blind pilots:

- wall time per sweep;
- memory consumption;
- acceptance rates;
- autocorrelation times;
- estimator variances;
- winding-sector transition rates;
- replica-exchange acceptance;
- resulting production lengths calculated by the frozen rule in §B.7.

The pilot system may calculate these quantities internally, but it must not display:

- Q1 fitted exponents;
- comparisons between the charge-two and ordinary-vector hypotheses;
- Q3 anisotropy trends across L;
- Q2 asymptotic direction;
- first-order verdicts at target production points.

B.0.3 Pre-execution failure rule

If blind timing pilots show that the frozen ladder cannot be completed under the resource ceiling, the project must stop before target production.

A reduced ladder requires a new protocol version and new hash.

After target production begins, resource exhaustion produces an unresolved result. It does not permit retrospective removal of expensive sizes or observables.

---

B.1. Canonical Branch Identifiers

Every run must carry exactly one branch identifier.

Identifier| Microscopic model| Representation| Boundary/sector| Primary role
"V-DUAL-FULL"| Villain| Dual| Fully link-summed PBC| CKT and pure-gauge calibration
"C-DUAL-FULL"| Cosine| Exact dual| Fully link-summed PBC| Stage-B Q1 production
"C-DIR-PBC"| Cosine| Direct| Full periodic gauge ensemble| Direct cross-validation
"C-DIR-XY0"| Cosine/XY| Direct| Trivial flat holonomy| Pure-XY calibration
"V-AX-PLUS"| Villain| Dual axial| Flat positive axial seam| CKT axial Q2 calibration
"V-AX-MINUS"| Villain| Direct axial| Flat negative axial seam| Seam-ratio validation
"C-AX-PLUS"| Cosine| Direct or dual axial| Flat positive axial seam| Conditional Q2 production
"C-AX-MINUS"| Cosine| Direct axial| Flat negative axial seam| Q2 normalization
"C-DIR-H6"| Cosine| Direct| Full periodic gauge ensemble| Stage-C Q3 production
"POTTS-AF3"| AF three-state Potts| Direct spins| Fully periodic bulk| Global six-state control

The fully link-summed branches satisfy the mod-two homology restriction established in Appendix A.

Accordingly:

[
\boxed{
\texttt{V-DUAL-FULL}
\text{ and }
\texttt{C-DUAL-FULL}
\text{ do not report }f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}.
}
]

Only an Appendix-A-validated axial sector may report that statistic.

---

B.2. Coupling and Observable Conventions

The cosine production action is

[
H_{\cos}

-J\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}
\sigma_{ij}\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)
-\kappa\sum_pB_p
-h_6\sum_i\cos6\theta_i.
]

Define

[
t=\tanh\kappa.
]

The physical field is

[
\Phi_i=e^{2i\theta_i}.
]

The physical susceptibility is normalized as

[
\boxed{
\chi_2

N\left\langle|m_\Phi|^2\right\rangle

\sum_rG_2(r),
}
]

where

[
m_\Phi=\frac1N\sum_i\Phi_i.
]

The integer winding convention at h_6=0 is

[
\boxed{
W_\alpha

\frac1L
\sum_{\ell\parallel\alpha}I_\ell.
}
]

The dimensionless winding quantity is

[
\boxed{
R_W

\frac13
\sum_{\alpha=x,y,z}
\langle W_\alpha^2\rangle
}
]

unless a directional axial observable is explicitly identified.

The Binder ratio is

[
\boxed{
U_4

1-
\frac{\langle|m_\Phi|^4\rangle}
{2\langle|m_\Phi|^2\rangle^2}.
}
]

A dual U_4 estimator is not assumed.

For dual Stage-B runs, the primary locator pair is

[
\boxed{
R_\xi,\ R_W.
}
]

For direct runs, the primary locator pair is

[
\boxed{
R_\xi,\ U_4.
}
]

A dual Binder ratio may enter only after a four-point estimator has been independently derived and validated.

---

B.3. Hard Resource Ceiling

The baseline resource ceiling is:

[
\boxed{
20{,}000\ \text{physical CPU core-hours}.
}
]

The corresponding baseline assumes up to 16 physical CPU cores.

The storage ceiling is

[
\boxed{
2.0\ {\rm TB}
}
]

for raw time series, checkpoints, histograms, correlators, manifests, and immutable derived outputs.

The maximum resident working-memory allowance is

[
\boxed{
112\ {\rm GiB}.
}
]

The remaining physical memory is reserved for the operating system, filesystem cache, and failure-safe checkpointing.

Maximum lattice sizes are:

[
\boxed{
L_{\max}^{\rm direct}=128,
}
]

[
\boxed{
L_{\max}^{\rm direct,Q2}=96,
}
]

[
\boxed{
L_{\max}^{\rm dual}=192.
}
]

The baseline budget does not assume GPU acceleration.

A GPU implementation may replace the CPU kernel only if, before execution freeze, it passes:

- bitwise or statistical reproducibility tests;
- direct comparison with the CPU implementation;
- detailed-balance tests;
- small-volume tests;
- and a new software/hardware hash.

Introducing a materially different GPU kernel after production begins creates a new execution branch and invalidates pooled timing assumptions.

---

B.4. Random-Number Architecture

B.4.1 Generator

Use

[
\boxed{
\texttt{Philox4x32-10}.
}
]

No implementation-defined default generator is permitted.

B.4.2 Master seed

For every chain, define the 128-bit master seed as the first 128 bits of

[
\boxed{
{\rm SHA256}
\left(
H_P
\Vert
H_A
\Vert
H_B
\Vert
H_C
\Vert
{\rm branch}
\Vert
L
\Vert
\kappa
\Vert
J
\Vert
h_6
\Vert
{\rm sector}
\Vert
{\rm chain_id}
\right),
}
]

where:

- H_P is the main-protocol hash;
- H_A is the Appendix-A hash;
- H_B is the Appendix-B hash;
- H_C is the code-commit hash.

Numeric parameters are encoded using their exact stored decimal strings, not platform-dependent binary formatting.

B.4.3 Domain-separated streams

The following operations use domain-separated Philox streams:

- rotor proposals;
- link proposals;
- cube proposals;
- plaquette-current proposals;
- even worms;
- odd worms;
- global membrane moves;
- replica exchange;
- bootstrap resampling;
- synthetic GOF generation.

The stream key is

[
{\rm SHA256}({\rm master\ seed}\Vert{\rm stream\ label}).
]

No stream is reused between chains or algorithmic functions.

B.4.4 Checkpoint state

Every checkpoint stores:

- complete configuration;
- complete RNG counter and key;
- sweep number;
- measurement number;
- accumulated histogram state;
- worm state, if a checkpoint occurs between completed macro-sweeps;
- file checksum.

Production checkpoints occur only between completed compound or macro-sweeps.

A resumed run must reproduce an uninterrupted reference run bit for bit through the next 1,024 scalar measurements.

---

B.5. Chain Counts and Initial Conditions

Run class| Independent chains
Coarse locator scan| 4
Bisection/refinement scan| 4
Calibration confirmation| 8
Stage-B Q1 production| 8
Stage-C Q3 production| 8
Axial Q2 dual production| 8
Direct seam-ratio endpoint runs| 8
Each thermodynamic-integration ladder| 4 independent ladders
First-order equal-weight confirmation| 8

B.5.1 Direct starts

For every eight-chain direct production point:

- four chains use a hot start;
- four chains use a cold start.

Hot start:

- independent uniform \theta_i\in[0,2\pi);
- independent allowed gauge links;
- required fixed seams or holonomies imposed afterward.

Cold start:

[
\theta_i=0,
\qquad
\sigma_\ell=+1
]

except where a negative seam or magnetic twist is required.

B.5.2 Full-dual starts

For every full-dual point:

- four chains start from
  [
  I_\ell=0,\quad M_p=0;
  ]
- four chains start from a randomized valid configuration generated by 10^4 unconstrained calibration macro-sweeps that are discarded.

The randomizer output must satisfy every exact divergence and parity test.

B.5.3 Axial Q2 starts

For every axial-positive Q2 point:

- four chains start in even winding, normally W_z=0;
- four chains start in odd winding, normally W_z=1.

The odd initial state is constructed by adding one oriented current loop around a fixed vertical column.

The column is chosen deterministically from the chain seed.

Initial winding parity must not determine the final chain label used in pooled analysis.

---

B.6. Sweep Definitions and Measurement Cadence

B.6.1 Direct compound sweep

One direct compound sweep contains:

1. one rotor Metropolis proposal per site;
2. one gauge-link proposal per dynamical link;
3. five rotor over-relaxation proposals per site;
4. one global holonomy proposal per direction every ten compound sweeps when the ensemble permits it.

At h_6\neq0, every over-relaxation move receives the required Metropolis correction.

B.6.2 Full-dual macro-sweep

One full-dual macro-sweep contains:

1. L^3 cube attempts;
2. 3L^3 coupled plaquette-current attempts;
3. completed even worms until cumulative worm length is at least 3L^3;
4. one noncontractible membrane-sheet proposal in each orientation.

B.6.3 Axial Q2 macro-sweep

One axial macro-sweep is the Appendix-A definition:

1. L^3 cube attempts;
2. 3L^3 coupled plaquette-current attempts;
3. completed even worms until cumulative path length reaches 3L^3;
4. one odd axial worm;
5. one explicit odd column-loop proposal;
6. one noncontractible membrane-sheet proposal in each orientation.

B.6.4 Scalar cadence

Record scalar observables after every completed compound or macro-sweep:

- energy components;
- matter derivative;
- gauge derivative;
- anisotropy derivative;
- R_W;
- |m_\Phi|^2;
- |m_\Phi|^4;
- A_3^\Phi;
- H_6;
- A_3^\Phi H_6;
- n_6;
- plaquette occupation;
- acceptance rates;
- winding and sector labels.

B.6.5 Expensive-observable cadence

Record or accumulate the following every four completed sweeps:

- structure factors;
- R_\xi;
- direct spatial correlators;
- fixed-separation G_2;
- charge-one axial correlators;
- angular histograms;
- energy and order-parameter histograms.

Worm endpoint histograms are accumulated continuously over completed worms and written at every checkpoint.

B.6.6 Checkpoint cadence

Write an atomic checkpoint every

[
\boxed{
1{,}024
}
]

completed compound or macro-sweeps.

The old checkpoint is retained until the new checkpoint passes its checksum.

---

B.7. Blind-Pilot and Production-Length Rule

B.7.1 Pilot visibility

The pilot controller may access estimator means and variances internally.

The analyst-facing report displays only:

- timing;
- memory;
- acceptance;
- \widehat\tau_{\rm int};
- estimated required sweeps;
- convergence status;
- reweighting overlap;
- sector transition count.

Cross-size target trends remain masked.

B.7.2 Initial pilot length

For each intended branch and size, run two pilot chains with:

[
2^{12}
]

thermalization sweeps followed by

[
2^{14}
]

measurement sweeps.

If the autocorrelation criterion below is not satisfied, extend both pilot chains by successive factors of two.

The pilot stops at the first length satisfying

[
N_{\rm pilot,chain}
\ge
200\widehat\tau_{\max}
]

and at least 64 candidate analysis blocks.

The pilot ceiling is

[
\boxed{
2^{20}
}
]

measurement sweeps per chain.

Failure to estimate autocorrelation below this ceiling is an algorithmic or mixing failure.

B.7.3 Precision targets

Observable| Acquisition target
R_\xi| absolute SE \le0.002
U_4| absolute SE \le0.002
R_W| absolute SE \le0.005
\chi_2| relative SE \le0.005
G_2(L/4)| relative SE \le0.010
G_2(L/2)| relative SE \le0.015
A_3^\Phi| absolute SE \le0.003
D_6| absolute SE \le0.005
f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}| absolute SE \le0.010, plus round-trip rule
C_1^{\rm ax}(z)| relative SE \le0.02 where signal exceeds 5\sigma
Seam integrand divided by L^2| absolute SE \le0.002
Twist integrand divided by stack area| absolute SE \le0.002

A relative target is not applied when the pilot mean is statistically compatible with zero. The corresponding absolute target is used instead.

B.7.4 Production-length calculation

Let:

- S_{\rm pilot} be the total number of pooled pilot measurement sweeps;
- \widehat{\rm SE}_{O,\rm pilot} be the blocked pilot standard error;
- \epsilon_O be the acquisition target;
- C be the number of production chains.

For every required observable,

[
S_{O,\rm req}

S_{\rm pilot}
\left(
\frac{
\widehat{\rm SE}_{O,\rm pilot}
}{
\epsilon_O
}
\right)^2.
]

Define

[
S_{\rm req}

\max_O S_{O,\rm req}.
]

The frozen per-chain production length is

[
\boxed{
N_{\rm prod}

2^{
\left\lceil
\log_2
\left[
\max
\left(
2^{16},
\frac{2S_{\rm req}}{C},
400\widehat\tau_{\max}
\right)
\right]
\right\rceil
}.
}
]

The factor two is a fixed variance-safety factor.

For Q2, include the sector-round-trip estimate:

[
N_{\rm RT}

\frac{
200
}{
\widehat r_{\rm RT}
},
]

where \widehat r_{\rm RT} is the pilot number of effective round trips per sweep.

Then replace the maximum above by

[
\max(\cdots,N_{\rm RT}).
]

The hard per-chain production ceiling is

[
\boxed{
N_{\rm prod}\le2^{25}.
}
]

If the calculated requirement exceeds that ceiling or the global resource cap, execution cannot be frozen under this parameter card.

B.7.5 Generated production table

The pilot controller writes:

production_lengths.csv

with one row for every branch, parameter point, lattice size, and chain class.

Required columns:

branch
stage
L
kappa
t
J
h6
sector
chains
thermalization_sweeps
production_sweeps
measurement_stride
tau_max_pilot
precision_limiter
estimated_core_hours
estimated_storage_bytes
pilot_hash

This file is hashed before target production begins.

B.7.6 One permitted blind extension

After the frozen production length is completed, the controller may apply exactly one extension of

[
\boxed{
2N_{\rm prod}
}
]

if, while target directions remain masked, any of the following occurs:

- split \widehat R>1.01;
- required ESS fails;
- achieved standard error exceeds 1.25\epsilon_O;
- Q2 effective round trips are below 100 per chain.

All chains at that point are extended equally.

No second extension is permitted.

Failure after the extension gives:

[
\boxed{
\text{INSUFFICIENT MIXING OR PRECISION}.
}
]

The relevant scientific verdict is then unresolved.

---

B.8. Thermalization and Convergence

B.8.1 Frozen thermalization length

Using the pilot autocorrelation estimate, define

[
\boxed{
N_{\rm therm}

2^{
\left\lceil
\log_2
\left[
\max
\left(
2^{14},
100\widehat\tau_{\max}
\right)
\right]
\right\rceil
}.
}
]

For axial Q2 chains, thermalization must additionally contain at least ten effective winding-parity round trips.

B.8.2 Convergence observables

Direct chains are checked using:

- matter energy;
- gauge energy;
- |m_\Phi|^2;
- R_\xi;
- U_4;
- H_6 when applicable.

Dual chains are checked using:

- current action;
- plaquette occupation;
- \chi_2;
- R_\xi;
- R_W;
- winding parity for Q2.

B.8.3 Required convergence tests

Before production begins:

[
\boxed{
\widehat R_{\rm split}\le1.01
}
]

for every convergence observable.

Also require:

[
\boxed{
{\rm bulk\ ESS}\ge400
}
]

and

[
\boxed{
{\rm tail\ ESS}\ge200
}
]

for the pooled thermalization diagnostics.

For every observable, the hot-start and cold-start final-quarter means must differ by less than two combined standard errors.

The mean of the second half of thermalization must differ from the final quarter by less than two combined standard errors.

B.8.4 Thermalization failure

One automatic doubling of thermalization is allowed before production.

If convergence still fails, the point does not enter production.

No production measurements are reclassified later as additional thermalization.

---

B.9. Autocorrelation, Blocking, and Resampling

B.9.1 Autocorrelation estimator

Use the \Gamma-method.

For each scalar observable, choose the first self-consistent window W satisfying

[
\boxed{
W\ge6\widehat\tau_{\rm int}(W).
}
]

The maximum allowed window is

[
W_{\max}=N/10.
]

Failure to find a stable window is reported.

B.9.2 Master autocorrelation time

For each run point define

[
\boxed{
\tau_{\max}

\max_O\widehat\tau_{\rm int,O}
}
]

over every primary observable available in that branch.

For Q2, include the winding-parity indicator in this maximum.

B.9.3 Block length

Set the analysis block length to

[
\boxed{
B

2^{
\left\lceil
\log_2
\left[
\max
\left(
32,
20\tau_{\max}
\right)
\right]
\right\rceil
}.
}
]

Incomplete final blocks are retained in raw data but excluded from block-bootstrap analysis.

B.9.4 Hierarchical bootstrap

Use

[
\boxed{
5{,}000
}
]

hierarchical bootstrap replicates.

For each replicate:

1. resample independent chains with replacement;
2. resample complete blocks within each selected chain;
3. reconstruct reweighted observables;
4. rerun critical-point interpolation;
5. rerun the complete frozen fit family;
6. store fitted parameters and verdict predicates.

Q2 winding counts are resampled as block-level counts, not as independent per-sweep Bernoulli trials.

B.9.5 Confidence intervals

Use the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the hierarchical bootstrap distribution.

All stated intervals are therefore 95% bootstrap intervals unless explicitly labeled otherwise.

B.9.6 Fit covariance

Use the full bootstrap covariance across:

- observables;
- couplings;
- sizes;
- fixed-R_\xi interpolations.

When the covariance matrix is numerically singular, diagonalize it and remove modes satisfying

[
\boxed{
\lambda/\lambda_{\max}<10^{-10}.
}
]

The number of retained modes is reported with every fit.

An uncorrelated fit may be shown as a diagnostic but cannot carry the primary verdict.

---

B.10. Reweighting and Interpolation

B.10.1 Direct cosine model

Store

[
E_J

\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}
\sigma_{ij}\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j),
]

[
E_\kappa

\sum_pB_p,
]

and

[
H_6

\sum_i\cos6\theta_i.
]

The exact configuration reweighting factor is

[
\boxed{
\log w'

\log w

(J'-J)E_J
+
(\kappa'-\kappa)E_\kappa
+
(h_6'-h_6)H_6.
}
]

B.10.2 Villain dual

Store

[
S_I=\sum_\ell I_\ell^2
]

and

[
N_M=\sum_pM_p.
]

For normalized expectation values, the configuration-dependent reweighting factor is

[
\boxed{
\log w'

\log w

-\left(
\frac1{2J'}-\frac1{2J}
\right)S_I
+
N_M\log\frac{t'}{t}.
}
]

Any J-dependent overall Villain normalization must be restored for free-energy derivatives.

B.10.3 Exact cosine dual

For every measurement block store the sparse count map

[
N_q

#{\ell:|I_\ell|=q}.
]

Then

[
\boxed{
\log w'

\log w

\sum_{q\ge0}
N_q
\log
\frac{
\mathcal I_q(J')
}{
\mathcal I_q(J)
}
+
N_M\log\frac{t'}{t}.
}
]

No current magnitude may be silently clipped.

The sparse histogram contains every observed q and an explicit maximum-current field.

B.10.4 Reweighting admissibility

For normalized weights \widetilde w_a, define

[
N_{\rm eff}^{\rm rew}

\frac1{
\sum_a\widetilde w_a^2
}.
]

Reweighting is admissible only when

[
\boxed{
N_{\rm eff}^{\rm rew}
\ge0.30N_{\rm raw}
}
]

and

[
\boxed{
\max_a\widetilde w_a\le0.02.
}
]

Adjacent simulated points must produce overlapping action distributions.

A reweighted estimate failing either condition is discarded.

Failure of a calibration branch blocks only the scientific stages depending on that branch.

For example, failure of finite-h_6 dual calibration does not block direct Q3.

B.12. Stage-B Q1 Production Table

All Stage-B points use

[
h_6=0.
]

B.12.1 Gauge points

Point| \kappa| t=\tanh\kappa| Initial J bracket
"P1"| 0.8000000000| 0.6640367703| [0.440,0.490]
"P2"| 0.8673005277| 0.7000000000| [0.440,0.490]
"P3"| 1.0000000000| 0.7615941560| [0.440,0.490]

The production size ladder is

[
\boxed{
L=
8,12,16,24,32,48,64,96,128.
}
]

The primary Stage-B representation is "C-DUAL-FULL".

Matched "C-DIR-PBC" confirmation runs are performed at:

[
\boxed{
L=12,24,48,96
}
]

for each gauge point at the final critical neighborhood.

B.12.2 Coarse locator grid

For each gauge point, run:

[
\boxed{
J=0.440,0.445,\ldots,0.490
}
]

on

[
L=12,16,24.
]

Only the dimensionless locator observables and histogram-quality diagnostics are opened.

Q1 exponent outputs remain masked.

B.12.3 Transition-bracket rule

A matter-transition bracket must satisfy:

1. a sign change in the difference of R_\xi between at least one adjacent size pair;
2. supporting crossing or convergence behavior in R_W;
3. no unresolved reweighting-overlap failure.

If the R_\xi and R_W brackets are disjoint, both brackets are retained and refined.

They may indicate:

- split transitions;
- strong crossover;
- or locator failure.

No single bracket is chosen by discretion.

B.12.4 Bisection rule

Refine every retained bracket on

[
L=16,24,32
]

using deterministic midpoint bisection until

[
\boxed{
\Delta J\le2\times10^{-4}.
}
]

Define the midpoint of the matter-ordering bracket as J_0.

B.12.5 Initial confirmation grid

For every production size, begin with

[
\boxed{
J

J_0+m(0.00075),
\qquad
m=-2,-1,0,1,2.
}
]

This spans

[
J_0\pm0.0015.
]

B.12.6 Mechanical grid extension

If the frozen target R_\xi^\star is not bracketed at a size, add one point at a time in the required direction using increments of

[
0.00075.
]

The maximum allowed extension is

[
\boxed{
|J-J_0|\le0.006.
}
]

The procedure is automatic and uses only R_\xi.

If the target remains unbracketed at the limit, that size is marked:

[
\boxed{
\text{FIXED-}R_\xi\text{ TRAJECTORY NOT REACHED}.
}
]

It cannot be replaced by an analyst-selected coupling.

B.12.7 Frozen point file

The finalized Stage-B grid is written to:

stageB_points.csv

and hashed before Q1 observables are unmasked.

---

B.13. Stage-C Q3 Production Table

Only "P1" and "P2" enter primary Stage C.

B.13.1 Field values

Primary critical fields:

[
\boxed{
h_6=0,\ 0.01,\ 0.02.
}
]

Negative-field controls:

[
\boxed{
h_6=-0.01,\ -0.02.
}
]

Nonlinearity sentinel:

[
\boxed{
h_6=0.04.
}
]

B.13.2 Size ladders

For h_6=0,0.01,0.02:

[
\boxed{
L=
8,12,16,24,32,48,64,96.
}
]

For h_6=-0.01,-0.02:

[
\boxed{
L=
8,12,16,24,32,48.
}
]

For h_6=0.04:

[
\boxed{
L=
8,12,16,24,32,48,64.
}
]

B.13.3 Fixed-R_\xi trajectory

For each gauge point, define

[
R_\xi^\star(t)
]

from the corresponding Stage-B h_6=0 branch.

For every nonzero h_6 and every size, determine J_L(h_6) from

[
\boxed{
R_\xi(J_L,h_6,L)

R_\xi^\star(t).
}
]

Initial search bracket:

[
\boxed{
J\in[J_c(t,0)-0.010,\ J_c(t,0)+0.010].
}
]

Coarse step:

[
0.0025.
]

After bracketing, bisect to width

[
2\times10^{-4}.
]

The initial confirmation grid is

[
\boxed{
J

J_{L,0}
+
m(0.0005),
\qquad
m=-2,-1,0,1,2.
}
]

The same mechanical extension and reweighting rules as Stage B apply.

B.13.4 Zero-field response

At h_6=0, measure

[
\boxed{
D_6(L)

{\rm Cov}
\left(
a_3^\Phi,
H_6
\right),
}
]

where the configuration-level harmonic is

[
a_3^\Phi

\begin{cases}
\Re\left[(m_\Phi/|m_\Phi|)^3\right],
& |m_\Phi|>10^{-14},\[4pt]
0,
& |m_\Phi|\le10^{-14}.
\end{cases}
]

The numerical-zero convention must be identical in every implementation.

B.13.5 Ordered-locking runs

For every positive primary h_6, define

[
\boxed{
J_{\rm lock}(t,h_6)

1.02J_c(t,h_6).
}
]

Run

[
L=16,24,32,48,64,96.
]

The ordered-side coupling is not retuned after angular histograms are opened.

---

B.14. Conditional Stage-D Q2 Table

This stage is sealed until Appendix A passes.

All Q2 production uses

[
h_6=0.
]

Only "P1" and "P2" enter primary Q2.

B.14.1 Ordered-side coupling

For each gauge point,

[
\boxed{
J_{\rm Q2}

1.01J_c(t,0).
}
]

The multiplication uses the unrounded fitted J_c.

B.14.2 Axial dual ladder

For f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}, C_1^{\rm ax}, C_2, and winding statistics:

[
\boxed{
L=
24,32,48,64,96,128,160,192.
}
]

Branch:

C-AX-PLUS

B.14.3 Direct seam-ratio ladder

For

[
Z_{\rm ax}^{-}/Z_{\rm ax}^{+}
]

and direct/dual normalization:

[
\boxed{
L=
8,12,16,24,32,48,64,96.
}
]

Use four independent 17-replica ladders with

[
\lambda=0,\frac1{16},\ldots,1.
]

B.14.4 Fredenhagen–Marcu ladder

Use

[
\boxed{
L=
16,24,32,48,64,96.
}
]

The square contour has side

[
r=L/4.
]

All listed sizes are divisible by four.

B.14.5 Magnetic-twist ladder

Use

[
\boxed{
L=
16,24,32,48,64,96.
}
]

Use four independent 17-replica ladders:

[
\lambda=0,\frac1{16},\ldots,1.
]

B.14.6 Q2 scale admissibility

A physical Q2 interpretation is admissible only when

[
\boxed{
L_{\max}
\ge
4\xi_{\rm conf}^{95%,{\rm upper}}.
}
]

Failure produces:

[
\boxed{
\text{Q2 INCONCLUSIVE — QUASI-DECONFINED WINDOW NOT EXCLUDED}.
}
]

No Q2 production is required at "P3".

---

B.15. Critical-Point Fit Package

B.15.1 Scaling variable

Define

[
x=(J-J_c)L^{1/\nu}.
]

For every dimensionless locator R_a, fit

[
\boxed{
R_a(J,L)

R_a^\star
+a_{a1}x
+a_{a2}x^2
+
L^{-\omega}
\left(
b_{a0}+b_{a1}x
\right).
}
]

B.15.2 Branch-specific locator sets

For "C-DUAL-FULL":

[
a\in{R_\xi,R_W}.
]

For "C-DIR-PBC" and "C-DIR-H6":

[
a\in{R_\xi,U_4}.
]

A direct helicity observable may be added as a cross-check.

A dual U_4 may be included only after estimator validation.

B.15.3 Frozen fit families

Family| \nu| \omega| Correction
"C0-XY"| 0.6717| —| none
"C1-XY"| 0.6717| 0.789| included
"C2-NU"| free on [0.60,0.80]| 0.789| included
"C3-FULL"| free on [0.60,0.80]| free on [0.4,1.3]| included
"C4-FO"| 1/3| —| first-order alternative

No fixed-point amplitude is shared between differing boundary or holonomy ensembles.

B.15.4 L_{\min} ladder

Run every admissible fit using

[
\boxed{
L_{\min}

12,16,24,32,48.
}
]

A fit requires:

- at least four lattice sizes;
- at least four residual degrees of freedom.

A fit window not meeting both requirements is not reported as admissible.

B.15.5 Goodness of fit

Use correlated nonlinear least squares.

Compute a parametric-bootstrap goodness-of-fit p-value using

[
\boxed{
2{,}000
}
]

synthetic datasets generated from the fitted covariance model.

Interpretation:

[
p_{\rm GOF}\ge0.05
]

is acceptable,

[
p_{\rm GOF}<0.01
]

is strong rejection.

---

B.16. Fixed-R_\xi Interpolation

For every hierarchical bootstrap replicate:

1. fit the critical-point locator;
2. extract J_c and R_\xi^\star;
3. solve
   [
   R_\xi(J_L,L)=R_\xi^\star;
   ]
4. interpolate all Q1 or Q3 observables to J_L;
5. retain the covariance arising from the common solution.

A central fit and its bootstrap replicates must use the same reweighting-admissibility mask.

No failed bootstrap replicate is silently replaced.

If more than 10% of bootstrap replicates fail to bracket R_\xi^\star, that size is removed from the corresponding fixed-R_\xi fit and the removal is reported.

The L_{\min} family is not otherwise modified.

---

B.17. Q1 Charge-Sector Fit Package

The target charge-two dimension is

[
\boxed{
\Delta_2=1.23629,
}
]

giving

[
\boxed{
\kappa_2=3-2\Delta_2=0.52742.
}
]

The ordinary-vector alternative is

[
\boxed{
\Delta_1=0.519088,
}
]

giving

[
\boxed{
\kappa_1=3-2\Delta_1=1.961824.
}
]

B.17.1 Susceptibility family

At fixed R_\xi, fit

[
\boxed{
\chi_2(L)

b_0+
aL^\kappa
\left(
1+cL^{-\omega}
\right).
}
]

The additive background b_0 is mandatory.

Frozen exponent hypotheses:

"Q1-H2"

[
\kappa=0.52742.
]

"Q1-H1"

[
\kappa=1.961824.
]

"Q1-HFREE"

[
0\le\kappa\le3.
]

"Q1-HFO"

[
\kappa=3.
]

Each hypothesis is run with:

1. c=0;
2. c\neq0,\ \omega=0.789;
3. c\neq0,\ \omega\in[0.4,1.3].

"Q1-HFO" cannot carry a first-order verdict without the independent histogram package in §B.19.

B.17.2 Spatial-correlator family

Primary fractional separations are

[
\boxed{
s=\frac14,\frac12.
}
]

For sizes divisible by three, retain

[
s=\frac13
]

as a secondary point.

Average over all three lattice axes and both displacement signs.

Fit

[
\boxed{
G_2(sL,L)

L^{-2\Delta}
\left(
a_s+c_sL^{-\omega}
\right),
}
]

with:

- one common \Delta;
- separate amplitudes a_s,c_s;
- the same L_{\min} ladder.

Frozen hypotheses:

[
\Delta=1.23629,
]

[
\Delta=0.519088,
]

and

[
\Delta\text{ free on }[0.4,1.5].
]

B.17.3 Q1 support rule

Q1 is SUPPORTED only if all conditions hold:

1. the first-order package does not fire;
2. "Q1-H2" has
   [
   p_{\rm GOF}\ge0.05
   ]
   for at least three consecutive admissible L_{\min} windows, including the largest;
3. the free-\kappa 95% interval contains 0.52742;
4. that interval excludes 1.961824;
5. the best admissible charge-two fit beats the best ordinary-vector fit by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
6. the free spatial-correlator interval contains 1.23629;
7. that interval excludes 0.519088;
8. the fitted exponent changes by less than one combined standard deviation across the final three admissible L_{\min} windows.

B.17.4 Q1 rejection rule

Q1 is REJECTED only if:

1. the charge-two target is outside the 95% interval in the final three admissible L_{\min} windows;
2. the target fit has p_{\rm GOF}<0.01 in those windows or loses by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
3. at least one preregistered alternative fits acceptably;
4. susceptibility and spatial-correlator analyses agree on the rejection.

If ordinary-vector scaling passes these conditions, report:

[
\boxed{
\text{Q1 REJECTED — ORDINARY-VECTOR LANE SUPPORTED}.
}
]

B.17.5 Q1 unresolved rule

Every other outcome is

[
\boxed{
\text{Q1 UNRESOLVED}.
}
]

A visually appealing effective slope is not a verdict.

B.18. Q3 Anisotropy Fit Package

B.18.1 Primary critical harmonic

[
\boxed{
A_3^\Phi(L,h_6)

\left\langle
\cos[3\arg(m_\Phi)]
\right\rangle.
}
]

B.18.2 Zero-field response

At h_6=0,

[
\boxed{
D_6(L)

{\rm Cov}(a_3^\Phi,H_6).
}
]

Fit

[
\boxed{
D_6(L)

aL^{y_6}
\left(
1+cL^{-\omega}
\right).
}
]

Frozen families:

1. c=0;
2. \omega=0.789;
3. \omega\in[0.4,1.3].

B.18.3 Finite-field joint fit

Fit the positive and negative small fields jointly:

[
\boxed{
A_3^\Phi(L,h_6)

a_0h_6L^{y_6}
\left(
1+a_1L^{-\omega}
\right)
+
b_3h_6^3L^{3y_6}.
}
]

The sign of h_6 is retained.

The h_6=0.04 data are excluded from the primary fit unless the fitted cubic contribution is below 20% of the linear contribution over every included size.

They remain a mandatory nonlinearity diagnostic.

B.18.4 Sign-reversal test

At matched L and |h_6|, test

[
\boxed{
A_3^\Phi(L,-h_6)

-A_3^\Phi(L,+h_6).
}
]

Define the normalized discrepancy

[
Z_{\rm sign}

\frac{
A_3^\Phi(+h_6)+A_3^\Phi(-h_6)
}{
\sqrt{
{\rm Var}[A_3^\Phi(+h_6)]
+
{\rm Var}[A_3^\Phi(-h_6)]
}
}.
]

Require

[
|Z_{\rm sign}|\le2
]

for the pooled matched-field test.

B.18.5 Nonzero-asymptote alternative

At fixed positive h_6, fit

[
\boxed{
A_3^\Phi(L,h_6)

A_\infty(h_6)
+
cL^{-p},
\qquad
p>0.
}
]

B.18.6 Ordered locking

At J_{\rm lock}, fit

[
\boxed{
A_{3,\rm lock}^\Phi(L)

A_{\rm lock,\infty}
+
cL^{-p}.
}
]

Ordered locking is supported only when

[
\boxed{
A_{\rm lock,\infty}^{95%,{\rm lower}}>0.
}
]

B.18.7 Q3 support rule

Q3 irrelevance is SUPPORTED only when:

1. the upper 95% bound on y_6 from D_6 is below zero;
2. the upper 95% bound from the finite-field joint fit is below zero;
3. both conditions survive the final three admissible L_{\min} windows;
4. the nonzero critical asymptote model loses by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
5. the sign-reversal test passes;
6. the ordered-locking lower bound is positive;
7. no first-order criterion fires.

B.18.8 Q3 rejection rule

Q3 is REJECTED when either:

- the lower 95% bound on y_6 is nonnegative in both primary fit lanes; or
- a stable nonzero critical asymptote is preferred by
  [
  \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10
  ]
  across the final three L_{\min} windows.

B.18.9 Q3 unresolved rule

Every other outcome is

[
\boxed{
\text{Q3 UNRESOLVED}.
}
]

A nonzero local dual source density cannot change that verdict.

---

B.19. First-Order Fit Package

B.19.1 Equal-weight point

For each L, determine the coupling at which the two candidate energy peaks have equal integrated weight using admissible reweighting.

If no stable two-peak description exists, no equal-weight point is declared.

B.19.2 Histogram storage

During pilots, determine a fixed energy range covering all observed values plus 10% margin.

Before production, freeze:

- 512 equally spaced energy-density bins;
- 512 equally spaced |m_\Phi| bins.

Production bin edges are stored in the point table and cannot change afterward.

Raw scalar time series are retained, so histogram analyses can be independently reconstructed.

B.19.3 One- versus two-component model

Fit:

- a single Gaussian component;
- a two-Gaussian mixture with ordered means.

The two-component description is strongly preferred when

[
\boxed{
\Delta{\rm BIC}\ge10.
}
]

B.19.4 Free-energy barrier

At the equal-weight point, define

[
\boxed{
\Delta F_L

\ln
\frac{
\sqrt{P_{\max,1}P_{\max,2}}
}{
P_{\min}
}.
}
]

Fit

[
\boxed{
\Delta F_L

c_2L^2+c_0+c_{-1}L^{-1}.
}
]

B.19.5 Latent-heat estimator

Let the fitted energy-density peak locations be

[
e_1(L),\ e_2(L).
]

Fit

[
\boxed{
\Delta e(L)

|e_2(L)-e_1(L)|

\Delta e_\infty+cL^{-1}.
}
]

B.19.6 First-order verdict

The continuous lane fails only if all conditions hold:

1. the two-component model wins by
   [
   \Delta{\rm BIC}\ge10
   ]
   for at least the three largest sizes;
2. the lower 95% bound on c_2 is positive;
3. either
   [
   \Delta e_\infty^{95%,{\rm lower}}>0
   ]
   or a susceptibility fit supports L^3 growth;
4. hot- and cold-start chains tunnel between both peaks or a validated extended-ensemble method establishes their relative weights.

Finite-size bimodality alone does not fire the verdict.

---

B.20. Conditional Q2 Fit Package

This section becomes active only after Appendix A changes status to:

[
\boxed{
\text{Q2 SECTOR VALIDATED — PHYSICAL VERDICT STILL CONDITIONAL}.
}
]

B.20.1 Axial odd-winding likelihood

Let each block contain:

- n_b axial winding observations;
- k_b odd observations.

Use the block-bootstrap count likelihood.

Persistent model

[
\boxed{
{\rm logit},f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}(L)

b_0+b_1L^{-\omega_o},
\qquad
\omega_o>0.
}
]

Suppressed model

[
\boxed{
{\rm logit},f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}(L)

b_0-
\left(
\frac{L}{\lambda_o}
\right)^p.
}
]

Primary:

[
p=1.
]

Secondary:

[
p\in[0.5,2].
]

No Gaussian approximation is used for rare odd-sector counts.

B.20.2 Charge-one radius

Fit

[
\boxed{
C_1^{\rm ax}(z;L)

A
\frac{
\cosh[(L/2-z)/\xi_{\rm conf}]
}{
\sinh[L/(2\xi_{\rm conf})]
}.
}
]

Use separations

[
z=1,\ldots,L/2.
]

Points with a nonpositive estimated covariance eigenmode after regularization are excluded as a complete covariance mode, not individually selected by signal appearance.

Competing long-range model:

[
\boxed{
C_1^{\rm ax}(z;L)

C_\infty
+
A
\frac{
\cosh[(L/2-z)/\xi]
}{
\sinh[L/(2\xi)]
}.
}
]

The production confinement estimate is the finite-\xi fit parameter, with its full bootstrap interval.

B.20.3 Seam-ratio identity

For every matched direct/dual size, require

[
\boxed{
1-2f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax}

\frac{
Z_{\rm ax}^{-}
}{
Z_{\rm ax}^{+}
}.
}
]

A reproducible failure closes Q2 and invalidates all odd-winding interpretation.

B.20.4 FM models

Fit the Fredenhagen–Marcu ratio to:

Vanishing model

[
\boxed{
R_{\rm FM}(L)

aL^{-p}
\left(
1+cL^{-\omega}
\right),
\qquad
p>0.
}
]

Nonzero-asymptote model

[
\boxed{
R_{\rm FM}(L)

R_\infty+cL^{-p}.
}
]

The FM result remains secondary.

B.20.5 Twist result

The magnetic-twist free energy is reported as

[
\Delta F_{\rm tw}(L)
]

with its full size dependence.

No universal power is imposed.

It is compared against:

- pure-gauge calibration behavior;
- the axial sector result;
- C_1^{\rm ax};
- FM.

B.20.6 Evidence for confinement

Report EVIDENCE FOR CONFINEMENT only when:

1. the Appendix-A sector identity passes;
2. the size-admissibility condition passes;
3. the suppressed odd-winding model beats the persistent model by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
4. the final-size estimate satisfies
   [
   f_{\rm odd}^{\rm ax,95%,upper}<0.05;
   ]
5. the finite-\xi_{\rm conf} model beats the long-range model by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
6. FM favors a nonzero asymptote;
7. the twist result does not contradict the confinement interpretation.

B.20.7 Evidence for deconfinement

Report EVIDENCE FOR DECONFINEMENT only when:

1. the Appendix-A sector identity passes;
2. the size-admissibility condition passes;
3. the persistent odd-winding model beats the suppressed model by
   [
   \Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10;
   ]
4. the asymptotic lower 95% bound satisfies
   [
   f_{\rm odd,\infty}^{\rm ax,95%,lower}>0;
   ]
5. the long-range C_1^{\rm ax} model is preferred;
6. FM favors a vanishing limit;
7. the twist result does not contradict the deconfinement interpretation.

B.20.8 Q2 unresolved outcomes

Q2 is unresolved if:

- L_{\max}<4\xi_{\rm conf}^{95%,upper};
- the sector identity fails;
- sector round trips fail;
- models are not strongly distinguishable;
- axial directions disagree;
- FM disagrees with winding/radius behavior;

- or the resource ceiling is reached.

The mandatory label for scale failure is

B.21. Model Comparison and Stability Rules

B.21.1 AICc

For a model with k fitted parameters, n retained correlated data points, and maximized Gaussian log likelihood \ell,

[
\boxed{
{\rm AICc}

2k-2\ell
+
\frac{
2k(k+1)
}{
n-k-1
}.
}
]

AICc is not reported when

[
n\le k+1.
]

B.21.2 Strong preference

A difference

[
\boxed{
\Delta{\rm AICc}\ge10
}
]

is the frozen strong-preference threshold.

B.21.3 Stability across L_{\min}

For fitted parameter \vartheta, define consecutive-window displacement

[
D_i

\frac{
|\widehat\vartheta_i-\widehat\vartheta_{i+1}|
}{
\sqrt{
{\rm SE}i^2+{\rm SE}{i+1}^2
}
}.
]

A result is stable when

[
\boxed{
D_i<1
}
]

for both transitions among the final three admissible L_{\min} windows.

B.21.4 Reporting requirement

Every frozen model and every admissible L_{\min} result is retained in the final fit ledger.

The preferred model may be highlighted, but failed or competing fits are not deleted.

B.23. Immutable Output and Hash Procedure

B.23.1 Preregistration bundle

Before target production, create:

protocol_v0.3-RC1.md
appendix_A.md
appendix_B.md
parameter_card.yaml
calibration_points.csv
stageB_points.csv
stageC_points.csv
stageD_points.csv
production_lengths.csv
fit_models.yaml
raw_schema.json
software_lock.txt
hardware_fingerprint.json

Each file receives SHA-256.

B.23.2 Execution manifest

Create a lexicographically sorted JSON-lines manifest containing:

relative_path
byte_length
sha256
artifact_role

The execution root is

[
\boxed{
H_{\rm execution}

{\rm SHA256}({\rm manifest}).
}
]

No target production begins until H_{\rm execution} is written to a read-only record.

B.23.3 Raw-file hashing

Every completed raw chain file receives SHA-256 immediately after clean close.

Checkpoint files are separately hashed but are not substituted for completed raw files.

B.23.4 Derived-output rule

Derived tables and plots are written to a separate directory.

Raw files are never overwritten.

Every derived artifact records:

- input raw hashes;
- analysis code commit;
- fit-model hash;
- bootstrap seed;
- creation time.

B.23.5 Bug-fix rule

A post-freeze bug requires:

1. a new code commit;
2. a written bug classification;
3. a list of affected branches and points;
4. invalidation of every affected output;
5. a new execution root;
6. complete rerun of affected points.

No corrected output may retain the old execution root.

B.26. Frozen Result

Appendix B freezes the complete pre-run witness architecture:

[
\boxed{
\text{parameter points}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\text{size ladders}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\text{blind production lengths}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\text{fit families}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\text{verdict predicates}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\text{resource ceiling}
}
]

and

[
\boxed{
\text{immutable raw-output root}.
}
]

The only values generated after structural freeze and before execution freeze are machine-performance quantities calculated through the blind-pilot rule.

Those generated values are themselves frozen and hashed before target production begins.

No parameter is moved because an exponent looks promising.

No size is removed because a crossover is inconvenient.

No run is extended because a preferred verdict is nearly significant.

No fit family is invented after seeing residuals.

No Q2 result escapes the sector and scale gates.

No resource failure is converted into a theory failure.

[
\boxed{
\textbf{Appendix A makes the sector real.}
}
]

[
\boxed{
\textbf{Appendix B makes the test immutable.}
}
]

Freeze the parameters. Blind the targets. Hash the machine. Then let the lattice answer.

Appendix B Amendment

B.3.1 Blind-Pilot Forecast Gate

After all calibration-only blind timing pilots are complete and the frozen production-length table has been generated, calculate

[
\boxed{
C_{\rm forecast}

C_{\rm pilot,actual}
+
\sum_r C_{r,\rm forecast}.
}
]

Here:

- C_{\rm pilot,actual} is the physical CPU core-hour cost already consumed by the calibration-only blind timing pilots;
- C_{r,\rm forecast} is the forecast physical CPU core-hour cost of each remaining frozen run class under the proposed execution root.

The forecast must include all authorized work required by the frozen protocol:

- remaining calibration and validation runs;
- coupling-location and deterministic refinement scans;
- Stage-B Q1 production;
- Stage-C Q3 production;
- Stage-D Q2 production when Stage D is authorized under the same execution root;
- thermalization;
- production measurements;
- direct/dual confirmation runs;
- seam and twist thermodynamic-integration ladders;
- replica-exchange work;
- mandatory checkpointing and measurement overhead.

The nominal forecast does not include the optional one-time blind production extension permitted by §B.7.6.

The difference

[
C_{\max}-C_{\rm forecast}
]

is the reserved contingency for those permitted extensions, unforeseen autocorrelation growth, and other preregistered execution variance.

The hard resource ceiling remains

[
\boxed{
C_{\max}=20{,}000
\ \text{physical CPU core-hours}.
}
]

The pre-execution forecast threshold is

[
\boxed{
C_{\rm forecast}\le14{,}000
\ \text{physical CPU core-hours}.
}
]

If

[
\boxed{
C_{\rm forecast}>14{,}000
\ \text{physical CPU core-hours},
}
]

the mandatory status is

[
\boxed{
\textbf{EXECUTION HALTED}.
}
]

No target-production run may begin under the current protocol version or execution root.

No partial execution of the target ladder is permitted.

No lattice size, coupling point, observable, chain, thermodynamic-integration window, or scientific branch may be removed selectively after the forecast has been calculated in order to pass the gate.

The only permitted remedies are:

1. issue an amended protocol version that changes the resource schedule, parameter ladder, or run architecture before target production begins; or
2. raise C_{\max} before execution and create a new Appendix-B hash, parameter-card hash, production-length hash, execution manifest, and execution root.

After either remedy, the blind-pilot forecast must be recalculated under the amended frozen configuration.

Calibration-only blind pilots used to construct C_{\rm forecast} do not constitute target execution.

Passing this gate does not guarantee completion of every permitted blind extension. It establishes that the nominal frozen campaign leaves at least

[
\boxed{
20{,}000-14{,}000

6{,}000
\ \text{core-hours}
}
]

of preregistered contingency.

Companion Execution-Freeze Checklist Entry

Add the following item to §B.25:

- [ ] Blind-pilot forecast completed, C_{\rm forecast}\le14{,}000 physical CPU core-hours, and the forecast input/output files are included in the execution manifest.

---

Required Forecast Artifact

The blind-pilot controller must write:

resource_forecast.csv

with, at minimum, the following columns:

stage
branch
run_class
L
kappa
t
J
h6
sector
chains
replicas
thermalization_sweeps
production_sweeps
estimated_core_hours
forecast_basis
pilot_hash
included_in_execution_root

It must also write a summary record containing:

pilot_core_hours_actual
remaining_nominal_core_hours
C_forecast
C_max
contingency_core_hours
forecast_gate_threshold
forecast_gate_status

Both files receive SHA-256 hashes and are included in the execution manifest.

The gate passes only when the recorded status is:

[
\boxed{
\texttt{FORECAST_GATE_PASSED}
}
]

with

[
\boxed{
C_{\rm forecast}\le14{,}000.
}
]


B.3.1 Blind-Pilot Forecast Gate

After all calibration-only blind timing pilots are complete and the frozen
production-length table has been generated, calculate

[
C_forecast = C_pilot,actual + sum_r C_r,forecast.
]

C_pilot,actual is the physical CPU core-hour cost already consumed by the
calibration-only blind timing pilots. C_r,forecast is the forecast physical
CPU core-hour cost of each remaining frozen run class under the proposed
execution root.

The forecast must include all authorized work required by the frozen protocol:
remaining calibration and validation; coupling-location and deterministic
refinement scans; Stage-B Q1 production; Stage-C Q3 production; Stage-D Q2
production when Stage D is authorized under the same execution root;
thermalization; production measurements; direct/dual confirmation; seam and
twist thermodynamic-integration ladders; replica-exchange work; mandatory
checkpointing and measurement overhead.

The nominal forecast does not include the optional one-time blind production
extension permitted by §B.7.6.

The difference C_max − C_forecast is the reserved contingency for those
permitted extensions, unforeseen autocorrelation growth, and other
preregistered execution variance.

The hard resource ceiling remains

[
C_max = 20,000 physical CPU core-hours.
]

The pre-execution forecast threshold is

[
C_forecast ≤ 14,000 physical CPU core-hours.
]

If C_forecast > 14,000, the mandatory status is

[
EXECUTION HALTED.
]

No target-production run may begin under the current protocol version or
execution root. No partial execution of the target ladder is permitted. No
lattice size, coupling point, observable, chain, thermodynamic-integration
window, or scientific branch may be removed selectively after the forecast
has been calculated in order to pass the gate.

The only permitted remedies are:

1. issue an amended protocol version that changes the resource schedule,
   parameter ladder, or run architecture before target production begins; or
2. raise C_max before execution and create a new Appendix-B hash,
   parameter-card hash, production-length hash, execution manifest, and
   execution root.

After either remedy, the blind-pilot forecast must be recalculated under the
amended frozen configuration.

Calibration-only blind pilots used to construct C_forecast do not constitute
target execution.

Passing this gate does not guarantee completion of every permitted blind
extension. It establishes that the nominal frozen campaign leaves at least

[
20,000 − 14,000 = 6,000 core-hours
]

of preregistered contingency.

The blind-pilot controller must write resource_forecast.csv with, at minimum:

stage, branch, run_class, L, kappa, t, J, h6, sector, chains, replicas,
thermalization_sweeps, production_sweeps, estimated_core_hours,
forecast_basis, pilot_hash, included_in_execution_root

and a summary record containing:

pilot_core_hours_actual
remaining_nominal_core_hours
C_forecast
C_max
contingency_core_hours
forecast_gate_threshold
forecast_gate_status

Both files receive SHA-256 hashes and are included in the execution manifest.

The gate passes only when the recorded status is FORECAST_GATE_PASSED and

[
C_forecast ≤ 14,000.
]


B.3.2 Immutable Pilot Provenance

Every calibration-only blind pilot used to calculate C_forecast must produce
an immutable output file containing, at minimum:

protocol_hash
appendix_a_hash
appendix_b_hash
appendix_b_amendment_hash
code_commit
compiler_and_flags_hash
dependency_lock_hash
hardware_fingerprint_hash
branch
run_class
L
kappa
t
J
h6
sector
chain_id
seed
pilot_start_utc
pilot_end_utc
thermalization_sweeps
measurement_sweeps
measured_core_seconds
measured_wall_seconds
physical_core_count
peak_memory_bytes
raw_output_bytes
tau_max_pilot
acceptance_statistics
sector_transition_statistics
pilot_status

Every pilot file receives SHA-256 immediately after clean close.

The pilot files are listed in a lexicographically sorted manifest:

pilot_outputs.manifest.jsonl

Each manifest row contains:

relative_path, byte_length, sha256, branch, run_class, L, chain_id,
artifact_role

Define the immutable pilot-output root as

[
H_pilot = SHA256(pilot_outputs.manifest.jsonl).
]

The resource forecast must contain the exact field
pilot_outputs_manifest_hash with value H_pilot. It must also contain:

forecast_script_hash
forecast_script_commit
production_lengths_hash
frozen_run_inventory_hash
appendix_b_amendment_hash

A forecast lacking any of those provenance fields is invalid.

Pilot outputs may not be overwritten, edited, or replaced in place. A
repeated or corrected pilot produces new pilot files, a new pilot manifest,
a new H_pilot, a new resource forecast, and a new execution root.

Calibration-only blind pilots do not constitute target production, but they
are immutable preregistration evidence and form part of the execution
provenance chain.


B.3.3 Frozen Run-Inventory Reconciliation

Before calculating C_forecast, generate a canonical frozen run inventory:

frozen_run_inventory.csv

This inventory must contain one row for every required run unit under the
amended protocol, including:

stage, branch, run_class, L, kappa, t, J, h6, sector, chains, replicas,
integration_windows, required_status, parameter_source

Sort the inventory lexicographically using the frozen key:

stage, branch, run_class, L, kappa, J, h6, sector

Define

[
H_inventory = SHA256(frozen_run_inventory.csv).
]

The resource forecast must satisfy an exact one-to-one reconciliation against
this inventory.

Every required inventory row must appear in the forecast exactly once, except
where the forecast explicitly expands one inventory row into multiple chain
or replica rows. In that case, the expanded rows must sum exactly to the
chain, replica, and window counts specified by the inventory.

The forecast generator must report:

required_inventory_rows
forecasted_inventory_rows
missing_inventory_rows
unexpected_forecast_rows
chain_count_mismatches
replica_count_mismatches
window_count_mismatches
inventory_reconciliation_status

The only passing status is INVENTORY_RECONCILIATION_PASSED with

missing_inventory_rows = 0
unexpected_forecast_rows = 0
chain_count_mismatches = 0
replica_count_mismatches = 0
window_count_mismatches = 0

If any required lattice size, coupling, branch, control, chain, replica
ladder, or integration window is absent, the mandatory result is

[
EXECUTION HALTED — FORECAST DOES NOT MATCH FROZEN INVENTORY.
]

No selective removal is permitted. In particular, an expensive point such as
L = 192 may not be removed, reduced, deferred, or relabeled as optional
merely to lower C_forecast.

The only permitted responses are:

1. issue a formally amended protocol version changing the frozen inventory; or
2. raise C_max before re-hashing.

No partial target execution may begin before the revised inventory and
forecast pass the gate.


B.3.4 Provenance Hash Chain

Freeze the parent-linked chain:

[
H_Theory → H_Protocol → H_AppA → H_AppB → H_AppBAmend
→ H_Inventory → H_Pilot → H_Forecast → H_Execution.
]

H_Theory = SHA256(Theory v0.1)
H_Protocol = SHA256(Protocol v0.3-RC1 containing H_Theory)
H_AppA = SHA256(Appendix A containing H_Protocol)
H_AppB = SHA256(Appendix B containing H_Protocol, H_AppA)
H_AppBAmend = SHA256(Appendix-B Amendment containing
H_Protocol, H_AppA, H_AppB)
H_Inventory = SHA256(frozen_run



Forecast first. Pass the gate. Hash the budget. No partial launch.
